## Setup and installation

In order to use the scripts provided in this repository you have to install the ITensor C++ library. To avoid platform specific problems you have to compile the library yourself. To do so follow the instructions of the [ITensor C++ installation guide](https://www.itensor.org/docs.cgi?vers=cppv3&page=install). Create your "itensor" library folder in the same directory you cloned this repo in. Your file structure should look like this:

|_ project_folder   
  |_ itensor   
    |_itensor   
    |_lib   
    +- options.mk   
    +- etc.   
  |_ gitlab_repo   
    |_ symmetric_tensor   
    +- README.md   
    +- etc.
